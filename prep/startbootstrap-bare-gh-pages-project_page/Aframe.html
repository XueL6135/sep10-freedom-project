I have come up with some solutions, we can of course import chips into dead people to find out more about them by collecting their data silently. of course there is 1% that the government would actually let us do that.
          -Adding to the chip idea I could also just run it through a computer and track the chip with the computer and control it since it is made for dead people." color="black" position="3 1.5 -3" width="20"></a-text>

It doesn't give off as much info as the chips but it does a great job at providing basic ones.
