# Summary of the Expo and Presentation

# In-class-presentation #
During the in-class presentation, I was very nervous, even though I have presented many times before. Presenting in front of a large audience is always nerve-wracking because you never know who will be judging you. However, I felt relieved after getting it over with, knowing that I didn't have to wait until the last minute. That's why I chose to proceed as early as possible, as I had the confidence early on. I did explain what I did with it and how I made it work by the shape codes that A-Frame provided to help me with my model. I explained how I couldn't make my nav bar stick on top because along with my template, it didn't let me. How I mostly used cards for most of my website/product (Software and hardware)  and being bootstrap helped me. 

# Challenges #
Some of the challenges that were demanding to me were how I had to make sure that I had to make eye contact with the audience which I was afraid that I didn’t but overall I felt like I did make some eye contact and not just at all. And I was afraid that my voice would not be loud enough for the audience to hear. Another thing was how I was forming my words and what came after that topic and what came after that. I guess I could say I was more of an unprepared speaker. Another real problem is when I forget to push my Adframe into my GitHub and I guess that flipped me off a bit when my model didn't show and only showed an incomplete version of my work.

# Skills #

During this presentation, you will need a lot of skills to present in a larger variety of audiences and that means you will need a louder voice especially if a person is in the back and away from your range of voice. Another would be the ability to speak, you want to speak in a form that people don't find boring or not to make them lose interest in another way of saying it. The ability to know what you are saying and not just forget the next line you are saying, so planning ahead of time on what you're going to say is a very important skill, in this case, is to plan.

# Takeaways #

Being that's over, overall in the presentation I would say it wasn't a success but more of an unplanned result and so what I would take away from this is to plan ahead of time for what I'm going to say next time and make sure of that. Everything is in place when I present so that the information I'm speaking out loud isn’t false. And to make sure that next time I will try not to mumble as I do in most cases when I’m nervous I tend to mumble. In the end, I would like to say that being confident now that I know what my weak points are, I would suggest improving that part and making sure when the time comes for my next big presentation I will make sure that I'm prepared.



# SEP-Expo #

The SEP expo is a lot different than the in-class presentation because the major difference is the number of people that you present to which is about only a few people of 3-4. It's much of a shorter and narrow audience. And the time that it consumes you isn’t much. During the expo, I presented to a lot of people which were mostly freshmen who were coming up from their class times. Since the tip was to present as fast as you can, I got a lot faster with my speech and how sloppy I was during my presentation. There were a lot of people in the cafeteria and of course, I needed to speak much louder. And the best part is that I wasn’t feeling as nervous as I was in the in-class presentation.

# challenges #

There weren’t as many troubles as it was in the in-class presentation but rather not as many because of how it went during that time. But the one thing that did pressure me was the amount of time that we had and it wasn’t a lot of time it was only about one or two minutes or so and to fit everything I had onto that time management was a struggle, I tried to fit everything on there and not make any slips but I probably did anyway. And the amount of free speech that I had to do without the help of my slides was something else. Other than that it wasn’t that difficult in the expo besides the amount of time that we had.

# skills #
 
There were only a few skills that you needed to handle during this expo.
One is to:
1. Speak loudly - people cannot hear you in the cafeteria if you speak slowly, because of the other voices that are speaking in the cafeteria and that's a lot of people that you need to overpower through. And by the end of the expo that took a great amount of voice from me.
2. Time management - they will only give you a certain amount of time as said in the expo to present your product, and in that amount of time, you will need to try to explain everything to them without speaking too fast.
Engaging people - during the expo engaging people in your presentation is a great way to promote your presentation more but that's kind of optional. But doing that is a beautiful way to showcase your work and you also get to have practice with what you're going to say.

# take-aways #

The final say all is that all of this is just very time-consuming but the product that you are willing to work on is all worth it to showcase what you have done so far during the years, how you have improved throughout your troubles, and what the things that you have learned through. The journey is hard but once you do it more than a few times you will get to know that it's a lot easier than you think. I would like to say that during these months of hard work, I would say that there has been a big boost in my skills such as my confidence to stand up In a good crowd of people, and how presenting to others has been a lot easier.
