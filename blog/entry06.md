# Content

On my latest freedom project that I have done, mostly Plan.md, where I plan out my draft of what my website is going to look like, there are lots of things that I might need to consider, such as how well it's going to work out and how it might affect other things that I might have in mind as well. For my Plan.md, I did quite a lot over myself. The view of the website may look like it was just a little work, but it took me awhile to get one thing to work so that it wouldn't overlap with the other components that were on the website. The image is what I had a hard time with; either one is overlapping the other or one is under the other. I did try to make new things happen, such as putting clear words and text over the image, but I don't think that worked out quite well, so I kind of gave up on doing that after trying for an hour. But what I think was most relaxing and fun was making it look good at the end, not just some text on a page. I tried to make it look not like an eyesore to a naked eye and tried putting colors and a few borders, plus some fonts that I did on the text to make it look not boring.

# About my plan.md #

In my plan.md, it's sort of what I did over the past few works of my freedom project, which is to put everything together now that I have gotten most of the requirements, and those are the analysis that I did, the content that I did, and also all of the software and hardware that I did. I sort of organized them and put  them all on one website page that I could put them on. From introducing Foresic Science, which is my topic, to the value points that they have and what more things they need in order to make things easier in that field.

# Sources

There are some sites that I used for the plan.md, and one of the most trusted ones that I love would be [colorhunt](https://colorhunt.co) because of the availability of colors that they have and how easily it is for me to just copy and paste the colors onto my IDE. Another one would be as simple as [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com). I personally love how I can simply put fonts on my website while they also have the code for me to easily paste, while that only works sometimes. While this website might not do much, [Bootstrap Templates](https://startbootstrap.com/themes) is what started off my project in the first place because I found a nice template for me to use—not too advanced but basic enough for me to work on. I sometimes go onto the website itself to get myself inspired by those templates to see how and what kind of things I can add to my website and how I can maybe improve it.

# EDP

Right now on my EDP. I don't consider myself almost done yet, considering my plan. Since I feel like I'm still missing something, I'm not exactly proud of what I have but more on how I could fix it up and how I could make it more presentable for others. Right now, I'm more focused on how to put things together, even though I made a good wireframe plan. I still have trouble following the wireframe itself; most of the time, I just change things up a little, and sometimes I don't even know if I can make my wireframe possible. So I need to prepare myself more often to see if I can actually do this without stressing myself. But the process now is that I'm preparing everything right now to make sure that I have everything I need for the finale project.

# Skills

As regions are approaching right now, I do seem to find myself in a time management issue and wondering how I can improve it, but it seems I never have enough time afterwards. Either I'm tired whenever I get home or I've got to study for the upcoming exams. So what I need to do right now is plan out a schedule that I can work with constantly and consistently to make sure I get breaks in between before I move onto the next task so that I don't tire myself out. Because even after all this work, I also want to enjoy my time on my other favorite hobbies, such as reading, writing, and doing some art in my free time.
