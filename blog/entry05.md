# Context #
## Tool = A-frame ##
From March to April, I learned a lot about my tool and what it can do, as well as new things from it. Such as new codes, which are mostly from the tool itself, but none the less, it was very helpful. I learned how toanimate on the tool, learning more about how shapes work and how they form to become something even more of themselves, camera perception, and others, loading and displaying a 3D object. (I divided my work into steps on how I could deal with it, part by part. Which of the steps should I take after I do this? Most of the part is to use the code that I have learned so far and use it to tinker with the code in my IDE).

I learned about my tool through a list of YouTube videos that were already made years ago. Although some might think that that may not be a good idea since most of the things might be outdated, I can always change the version of the tool itself to match it up with the code I was doing, and that became very helpful since the most important thing about this is the process of learning my tool. and not just watching it to see if it works.

## changing it? ##
I did a lot of things when trying to change it. The first of course, was to test out the code and help myself with the process of improving it. I played with it, messed around with the code, and actually created something that I liked. Although sometimes it messed me up, other wise, I also didn't mess me up as often because I always spent hours fixing it.
