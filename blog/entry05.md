# Context #
## Tool = A-frame ##
From March to April, I learned a lot about my tool and what it can do, as well as new things from it. Such as new codes, which are mostly from the tool itself, but none the less, it was very helpful. I learned how toanimate on the tool, learning more about how shapes work and how they form to become something even more of themselves, camera perception, and others, loading and displaying a 3D object. (I divided my work into steps on how I could deal with it, part by part. Which of the steps should I take after I do this? Most of the part is to use the code that I have learned so far and use it to tinker with the code in my IDE).

I learned about my tool through a list of YouTube videos that were already made years ago. Although some might think that that may not be a good idea since most of the things might be outdated, I can always change the version of the tool itself to match it up with the code I was doing, and that became very helpful since the most important thing about this is the process of learning my tool. and not just watching it to see if it works.

## changing it? ##
I did a lot of things when trying to change it. The first of course, was to test out the code and help myself with the process of improving it. I played with it, messed around with the code, and actually created something that I liked. Although sometimes it messed me up, other wise, I also didn't mess me up as often because I always spent hours fixing it.

# Engineering Design process #
The Engineering Design process of now that I have visioned looking for I would be now that I have finished in learnign about my tool, I can always look back to my notes in case I missed anything or with my other friends to help me with this tool from people that also had done this tool. Right now at the EDP I would be more than happy in trying to make something new out of my code and something maybe out of my comfort zone, and it will be ok if I forget something it's because I can always go back to it and review in what i maybe have missed or sometimes I forget and I can always go rewatch the video again, and it never hurts to try. Right now I'm just planning out what my website will look like, using the 2 wire-frames that I have created. I Never know I might change it based on what I can do with my planning page.

# Skills #
I was able to do this with the skills that I have and that includes time management. It's very time-consuming, considering that I also have other things to do. Then, except for SEP, I needed to plan the perfect time for when I should do this and when I would do that, which is also divided by the activities that I love, such as reading and doing a bit of fun things I need to catch up on. Or it might be studying for a chemistry test or reviewing the lessons of my AP world history from today. And most of the time I just got home being tired from volunteering, tutoring kids. In any case scenario I need to prepare for the times when the worst is going to come and manage my daily life together.
